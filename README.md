# Voice Agent

This is a simple voice agent that includes two core components:  
- *STT (Speech-to-Text)*: Converts spoken audio to text.  
- *TTS (Text-to-Speech)*: Converts text responses back into spoken audio.  

The agent leverages OpenAI APIs and can be easily run locally.

> This project is developed and tested with *Python 3.11*. Please ensure you are using Python 3.11 for compatibility.
